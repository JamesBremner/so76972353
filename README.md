Given

- a graph where each node is labeled with a non-unique letter (A, B, C, D...)
- a root node index i
- a set S of letters e.g., (A, A, C)

Return a set of all connected (not necessarily fully connected) sub-graphs that contain the node at i and contain nodes that exactly match the set S in any order.
